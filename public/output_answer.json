    "studySummary": "The paper investigates the impact of MeCP2 deficiency on osteoblast function and bone histomorphometry in a murine model of Rett syndrome (RTT). It reports that the absence of MeCP2 leads to impaired mRNA expression of bone-specific markers such as Col1A1, Runx2, and Osterix, resulting in diminished osteoblast function and contributing to osteoporosis in children with RTT. The study utilized micro-CT analysis and histomorphometric evaluations to demonstrate significant alterations in bone parameters for both trabecular and cortical bone in Mecp2-null mice compared to wild-type controls. Additionally, the findings suggest that factors such as X-chromosome inactivation may influence osteoblast function and that clinical factors like nutrition and ambulation could exacerbate bone loss in humans with RTT. The research highlights the need for further exploration of therapeutic targets to address bone health in RTT.",

Alternatively, the presence\nof a normal X-chromosome in the HET females may modify speci\ufb01c\nparameters related to MAR and related functions with lesser impact\non the absolute volume of bone mass measured by micro-CT. We\nsuggest that as in neural tissue, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is\nthe major determinant of the extent of MeCP2 impact on osteoblast\nfunction. Both balanced and unbalanced XCI are known to substantially\nalter neural cell function and the same principle may apply for osteo-\nblasts and other bone cells responsible for bone remodeling.\nHowever, the lesser changes in bone mass in HET compared with\nMecp2-null mice were not consistent with the bone loss seen at an\nearly age in many young females with RTT. This thus suggests that\nancillary clinical factors (nutrition, ambulation etc.) may aggravate\nbone loss to greater extent in humans than observed in female HET\nmice and also that other factors at the cellular level may moderate the\nextent of osteoblast impairment in HET mice.

Cuddapah et al. recently reported that speci\ufb01c\nMECP2 mutations were associated with the severity of the neurologic\ndisease [24]. However, in this and other reports, BMD did not correlate\nwith a speci\ufb01c MECP2 mutation [9,24].

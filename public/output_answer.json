We \nreported that WNT3A can activate both the WNT/beta-catenin and the WNT/CaMKII pathways in articular \nchondrocytes with distinct, dose-dependent biological  outcomes12. This implies that the modulation of some \ntranscriptional targets of WNT3A will be due to the\u00a0activation of the WNT/beta-catenin-dependent pathway \nand others due to the activation of the CaMKII pathway. To elucidate the specific transcriptional signature of the \nCaMKII pathway activation by WNT3A, we performed an expression microarray analysis of human articular \nchondrocytes treated with WNT3A in presence of KN93 or of its inactive control compound KN92 (Fig.\u00a0 1a\u2013\nc).
